The Class Page will also contain links, a record of what we do in class each day, and more. **Bookmark the Class Page in your browser and check it daily.**
+ Once the syllabus is finalized, it will be available in electronic form (here) and as a PDF. After that, the electronic version will be updated as needed, with updates ==highlighted in yellow like this==. *The PDF version will only be updated occasionally and you should use it only for archival purposes.*

## About the course

In Organic Chemistry 2 you will **continue to learn about structure, properties, and reactivity of organic compounds**. Carbon-based molecules are central to a host of chemical and biological processes because of their broad range of structure and reactivity. The billions of organic compounds alone, ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals, make the field important for study. Yet, organic chemistry is also a highly integrated discipline that impacts and is impacted by the other branches of chemistry and other sciences, because **organic chemistry enables a molecular understanding of physicochemical phenomena in materials science, the environment, biology, and medicine**. Because the field has reached a high level of integration with these areas, progress in organic chemistry continues at a fast pace and much more remains to be discovered.

Before reading any further, here are some things to know:

1. **The pace of this course is dangerously fast**. One class meeting covers equivalent of one week of regular semester. Not only there is a lot of material introduced in a short amount of time, there is less time between classes. To reduce the risk of falling behind, check announcements and the calendar daily; get to work immediately on assignments; and above all stay active, ask questions and don't procrastinate. 
2. **College-level chemistry is more than just memorizing structures and reactions**. You will be asked to do more than just give answers to problems. Your goal should be to seek deep understanding of underlying concepts because they are universal and the list is much shorter than a disconnected list of reactions and reagents.
3. **Your success in the course depends on your willingness to be actively engaged during class time**. We will spend most of the in-class time practicing the skills related to learning targets. Students who approach the class with a passive mindset typically struggle, and often fail. Those who approach it with an active mindset, on the other hand, often surprise themselves with how much and how well they learn.
4. **Asking questions is a not a sign of weakness**. It is guaranteed that you will be confused, lost, and stuck every day we meet in class. **That's a good sign!** Asking and answering questions requires you to leave your comfort zones on a regular basis, but is a crucial ingredient in learning. 

:::info
**My #1 job as the professor is to make sure you succeed in learning.** Success in the course doesn't come cheap. Learning hard things involves hard work, a willingness to try things that might not work the first time, and the ability to improve using feedback. But I promise you that I will work to make CHEM 128B a class where you can make mistakes and grow safely and productively.

### Course materials and technology

**Textbook:** "Organic Chemistry" online textbook with integrated Study Guide and Solutions Manual by David Klein 4th edition published by Wiley (via Immediate Access). It is okay to use prior editions of the textbook but you may not have the access to the WileyPLUS platform.

**WileyPLUS:** Online learning platform with e-textbook, practice problems, videos, etc. WileyPLUS is integrated with Canvas and all links to assignments and materials will be posted on Canvas.

:::info 
This course is part of the Immediate Access program. All students have access to a digital version of the textbook and associated materials on the first day of class. Students who wish to purchase course materials on their own can opt-out before their account is automatically charged on the 10th day (5th day for Summer courses) of instruction. Contact the Kennel Bookstore for more details.
:::

**A personal computer**: running Windows or macOS, that can run desktop applications and has a reliable access to high-speed internet. A tablet device may work as well but the online homework platform is not yet optimized for mobile devices.

**A modern web browser**: Chrome is the recommended browser by Fresno State IT. Other browsers such as Edge, Firefox, or Safari are likely to work just as well but the support will be limited.

**Canvas:** The central repository for all course materials and information found here: [https://fresnostate.instructure.com](https://fresnostate.instructure.com).

**Document scanning tool or a tablet with pen imput**: Assignments in this course are handwritten on paper and some assignments are uploaded to Canvas as PDF. A mobile device with a scanning app can do a sufficient job at converting paper documents into PDFs. There are number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how to use it.

**Active Fresno State network account** so that you can access email, Canvas, and Google Suite. If you have any issue with accessing any of the above, please let me know as soon as possible. We will use a variety of additional course tools during the semester, but they will be free to use, and you will be taught how to use them as part of the class.

## Course goals

The goal of this course is to drive the student to appreciate the breadth of organic chemistry by facilitating an understanding of the principles, and the practice of applying them, to gain a working knowledge and appreciation of organic structure and reactivity. The second semester in the sequence also emphesizes that our only way to molecular knowledge is through experimentation; correlating structure with reactivity and function through wet chemical methods, spectroscopy, and use of computational simulations.

## Assumed prior knowledge and skills

This course is a continuation of CHEM 128A. I am assuming that you come to this course already familiar with concepts and skills introduced in CHEM 128A and you are able to:

- communicate the structure and reactivity of organic molecules using drawing and naming conventions;
- analyze bonding and its consequences on molecular structure and reactivity of organic molecules; and
- analyze the interplay between electronic amd steric interactions as well as stereochemistry to predict the reactivity and properties of organic molecules and reactive intermediates (carbocations, radicals, anions, etc.).

## Course-level learning objectives

Concepts and skills listed above will be further developed and reinforced in CHEM 128B. Upon successful completion of CHEM 128B students will be able to:

- predict products, infer substrates, and propose reagents needed to complete a chemical reactions;
- use spectroscopic data to deduce the structure of the molecule.
- use retrosynthetic analysis to plan multi-step synthesis of target molecules; and
- use curved arrow notation to depict organic reaction mechanisms including addition, elimination, substitution, rearrangement, functional group interconversions and redox transformations.

## Course workflow

I designed this course according to the flipped learning model, an instructional philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct instruction is done before class meetings through structured activities (reading assignments, lecture videos) and class time is repurposed for collaborative work and practice. This [video series](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250) highlights the basics of flipped learning.

Our class meetings are very long (3 hours and 15 minutes). To maintain our energy at sufficient levels, I envisioned the following timeline of each class meeting:

| Time | Focus | 
| :--- | :---- |
| 09:00–09:30 | Q&A and review of the Daily Prep assignment followed by a 5-min break|
| 09:30–10:00 | Focused group work on problems followed a 5-min break |
| 10:00–10:30 | Focused group work on problems followed a 5-min break |
| 10:30–11:00 | Focused group work on problems followed a 5-min break |
| 11:00–11:30 | Summary of day's topics, wrap-up fo the day and a 5-min break to get ready for LT Test |
| 11:30–12:15 | LT Test & Office Hours |

**Before class**, your task will be to review previously covered material and get familiar with the basic concepts of the upcoming lesson by reading the appropriate sections in the textbook and completing **Daily Prep** assignment. This way, you'll come to class ready to work, and we can skip the lecturing in class unless it's really needed.

**Class time** is intended to focus on *answering questions* and *doing active work*. There may be some small lectures or tutorials, but active work will be the main component since the best way to learn organic chemistry is by doing lots of problems.

**After class** you must continue to engage with the material through deliberate practice and reflection on the ideas discussed in class. As you study, you should write down your questions and put into words what you don't yet understand. This is the time when you'll work on **Daily Prep** for the upcoming class as well as **Integrated Problems** (IPs). 

:::info
**No class meeting on Wednesday**. Use that day to to rest and regroup after Monday and Tuesday meetings. My hope is that you will use that time to study, do practice problems, and reflect on feedback you receive from me. And of course, complete Daily Prep assignment for classes on Thursday and Friday. 
:::

## Learning activities and assessments

To achieve the learning objectives of this course you will do a variety of things, but not all of them will be formally assessed or graded. 


- **Daily Prep** are WileyPLUS assignments that lead you through an active reading of the textbook and videos. 
- **Learning Targets** are main skills and tasks you should be able to do if you're achieving the learning objectives of the course. You will be asked to "demonstrate" your knowledge and skills mainly by taking short quizzes on them at regular intervals. 
- **Integrated Problems (IPs)** are more challenging homework problems that cannot be confined to a single learning objective or textbook chapter. The correctness of the solution and clarity of communication are equally important. 
- **Final exam** will be on **Friday, June 10th, 2022 at 9:00 am**. The final exam is composed of 70 multiple choice questions designed by experts from the American Chemical Society.

## The grading system in CHEM 128B

:::warning
Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Please read this section carefully and ask questions as needed. 
:::

As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that *learning takes time* and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve *multiple attempts* that allow you to learn from your past mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I believe you should not be penalized for having a bad day that results in a bad test score, so long as you can show evidence that you've *eventually* learned what you need to learn. Course learning objectives are phrased as "at the end of the course the student should be able to…". Thus, nothing is final until the end of the course. 

I also strongly believe that *assigning points to your work is deeply unhelpful* for all parties involved. Points give the appearance of a scientific measurement, but in reality *all grading involves a judgment call by the instructor* based on their professional expertise. And points lead to arguments about points and grades (unhelpful) rather than learning and knowledge (helpful). I believe your work should be evaluated by just like everyone else's work in the real world is evaluated, i.e., by giving you: 

- *clearly defined standards* for quality, 
- *detailed verbal feedback* on your work instead of points, and 
- *opportunities to try again* based on the feedback. 
 
This gets you into a *feedback loop*, a conversation between you and me about your work, that continues until your work meets the standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the principles outlined above, in this course:

* *there are no points on your work* except for the final exam. (Daily Preps use 0 or 1 but that's not a point, that's a label.); 
* *there is also no partial credit* awarded on your work, because there's no points; and
* students can *revise and resubmit almost any piece of work*, several times over if needed, using the feedback at each stage to improve and grow.

This is not as weird as it sounds. **It's actually the way all human learning works, and the way most professionals are evaluated in their work**. It only seems strange because it's not how school is typically done. But school and the real world are, well, not necessarily aligned. We will take the "real world" approach. Keep reading for more details.

### How each assignment is graded

Refer to the table for an overview of who each assignment is graded. Details are explained below. 

| Assignment       | How it's graded                                      | What's recorded in Canvas.                         |  
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |  
| Daily Prep       | Completeness and effort only                         | `1` for complete, good-faith effort; `0` otherwise |  
| Learning Targets | Completeness and correctness                         | *Successful* or *Retry* (see below)                |  
| IPs              | Completeness, effort, correctness, and communication | `E`, `M`, `R`, or `N` (see below)                  |  
| Final exam       | Completeness and correctness                         | Points, 70 maximum                                 |  

#### Learning Targets

Your primary responsibility in the course is to demonstrate your achievement of Learning Targets. The primary way you'll demonstrate skill is through *Learning Target Tests* given at the end of each class meeting. Each test will contain a pool problems, one per Learning Target. Each _Learning Target Test_ is cumulative, meaning the number of LT problems will grow as we cover more material. Problems for _new_ LTs will be added along with _new versions_ of LTs that are already in the pool. 

Successful demonstration of learning on a Learning Target will be marked *Successful*, work that doesn't yet meet the standards will be marked *Retry*. Alternatively, you can demonstrate your skill on a Learning target via an oral quiz of sorts. I will give you a new version of a problem, and you work it out on the board "live". 

:::success
**_Successful_ does not mean "perfect" or "error-free"**. A limited number of minor errors is allowed. See the companion document titled [Standards for Assessment](https://hackmd.io/@hmuchalski/BJKWouND5) for detailed description of criteria for success.
:::


:::info
**Important**: Each _Learning Target_ requires two successful demonstrations of skill. Then, the Target is considered **completed** and no further assessment on that target is necessary.
:::

#### Integrated Problems (IPs)

Course grade of B or better asks you to show acceptable work on at least one Integrated Problem (IP). These problems involve a written solution as well as commentary that guides the reader throught the work. The process of assigning these marks is shown on the rubric diagram below:

![EMPX rubric](http://rtalbert.org/content/images/2022/04/EMRN-rubric-2020.png)

### Final letter grade

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column for that grade, **the highest grade for which all the requirements are met**. There are no statistical or numerical adjustments (a.k.a. grading on a curve). Failing grade (F) is given if not all the requirements for a "D" are met. In the table below, numerical values indicate the minimum level needed to meet the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the requirement. For IP's, "M+" means "M" or better (either "M" or "E").

| Category               | D               | C  | B   | A       |  
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -- | --- | ------- |  
| Daily Prep (16)        | 5               | 8  | 11  | 14      |  
| LTs Completed (16)     | 5               | 8  | 11  | 14      |  
| All CORE Completed (7) | No              | No | Yes | Yes     |  
| Integrated Problems    |                 |    | 1M+ | 1E, 1M+ |  
| Final Exam (ACS)       | 21              | 28 | 35  | 42      |  

:::success
**Example**: At the end of the semester Alex accomplished the following:

- completed 14 out of 16 Daily Prep assignments;
- completed (= done two successful demonstrations of skill on) 13 Learning Targets, including all CORE LTs; 
- submitted 3 IPs (one graded "E", two graded "M"); and
- earned 54 points on the final exam.

Looking across the column for grade of "B", Alex satisfied all the requirements for that grade. Although Alex's work on Daily Preps, IPs, and the final exam is at grade "A" level, not all requirements for "A" are met, and Alex earns "B" in the course. 
:::

:::info
**Important:** You can't prop-up work on IPs, for example, by doing more Learning Targets. Also, you don't have to do it all. If you aim for "A", you don't have to complete _every Learning Target_, only 14 of them (as long as all CORE LTs are among them). And let me repeat, to "complete" a Learning Target means to **demonstrate skill two times**. 
:::

## Revision and resubmission

Except for Daily Prep and the Final Exam, you can revise and resubmit any work you turn in, _without penalty_, until it meets course standards. How this works depends on the assignment.

**Learning Targets**. As detailed above, work on a Learning Target (via a quiz or other means) that doesn't meet the standards for "success" can be reattempted, through work on a new version of the same problem, on a later test or an oral quiz. No revisions are allowed after 12:15 pm PT on Friday, June 10.

**Integrated Problems**. An IP earning a mark of M, R, or N can be revised and resubmitted by uploading a revised version of the work to the same Canvas location where it was originally submitted (Canvas automatically keeps all versions of all uploads). Only two IP submissions per week are allowed. This can be new submissions of two different problems, revisions of two different problems, or one new submission and one revision.


## Academic integrity

:::warning
This course  is subject to [Standards of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.fresnostate.edu/studentconduct/academic-integrity/) and  [The Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/236.pdf). Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.
:::

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at others it may not be allowed. Here are the specific rules for the extend of collaboration on each kind of work you do:


| Assessment | Collaboration allowed |
| :--------  | :--------------------- |
| Daily Prep | Collaboration is allowed but responses must be your own and reflect your own understanding. |
| Learning Targets | **No collaboration is allowed at all** with other people (including online forums such as Stack Exchange, Reddit, Chegg). You are allowed to use resources from the class such as the textbook, your notes, and your past quiz work. |
| IPs | **No collaboration is allowed at all** with other people. You can use your textbook, notes, or other sources (printed or electronic) as long as source can be cited (preferably journal articles, books). |
| Final Exam | **No collaboration is allowed at all**. |

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is my determination to make based on the evidence. If I suspect that academic dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of Students office according to APM 235

:::info
**Important:** There's no need to be academically dishonest here, because you can revise and resubmit almost everything. Rather than give into temptation to cheat, *ask questions and use the feedback loop* so that you really grow and learn in the course.
:::

## Course policies

### Attendance and participation

Attenance is expected at all class meetings. The pace of the course is such that missing a class will result in falling behind immediately, and it's very hard to recover given the compressed nature of the schedule. Attendance will be recorded so I can keep track of it.

Participation is an essential element of attendance. As mentioned before, the class is designed using flipped learning model where the majority of in-class time is spent on active participation, as opposed to passive observation of the instructor lecturing from slides. 

### Absences

If you must be absent, you do not need prior permission or justification; a heads-up is appreciated. However *please avoid any non-essential absences* such as skipping class, or scheduling a vacation during a day where class is scheduled. If you miss, you are solely responsible for catching up. 

Missing a class meeting also means missing an opportunity to demonstrate skills on Learning Targets. There are no make-up LT test scheduled but if you miss class you can attempt LT problems at the next session.

### Deadlines and late work

Deadlines for Daily Preps, and IPs are listed on Canvas. In cases of apparent conflict between dates (different date on a description page and different in the calendar), always assume that the Course Calendar is right.

| Assignment | Deadline policy |
| :--------- | :-------------- |
| Daily Preps | Due at 11:59 pm the night before class. The deadline will not be extended. |
| IPs | Due on the last day of Summer Intersession but there is a limit of how many you can submit for grading per week. If you plan to submit IP for grading, start early so you can act on the feedback. | 

### Instructor availability and message responses

You have a right and the responsibility to ask a question about anything you don't fully understand, at any time. To ask me questions, you can use email, zoom office hours, or appointments.  

I do not always respond to all messages immediately because I have to prioritize a number of tasks throughout the week that make demands on my time; and I do not leave my email open all day. I typically respond to email **once per day** in the late afternoon. If you send a message on a weekday (Monday through Friday) before 3:00 pm PT, it will get a **same-day response**. Messages sent after 3:00pm on Fridays or on the weekends will get a response **no later than the following Monday afternoon**. 

### Technology issues when submitting work

It is the student’s responsibility to make sure these items are submitted on time, even if technology issues arise. Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload work to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later, use different browser, upload to Google Drive and share a private link or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.

### Intellectual Property

<!-- As part of your participation in virtual/online instruction, please remember that the same student conduct rules that are used for in-person classrooms instruction also apply for virtual/online classrooms.  -->
Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication of any academic presentation, including any online classroom instruction, for any commercial purpose. In addition, students may not record or use virtual/online instruction in any manner that would violate copyright law. Students are to use all online/virtual instruction exclusively for the educational purpose of the online class in which the instruction is being provided. Students may not re-record any online recordings or post any online recordings on any other format (e.g., electronic, video, social media, audio recording, web page, internet, hard paper copy, etc.) for any purpose without the explicit written permission of the faculty member providing the instruction. Exceptions for disability-related accommodations will be addressed by Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) working in conjunction with the student and faculty member.

<!-- ## Dropping the course

Dates and details on withdrawing from courses are described on the [Admissions web pages](http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html).

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition. Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor. -->

## University policies and disclaimers

In addition to course policies, you are expected to be familiar with Academic Regulations described in the [University Catalog](http://www.fresnostate.edu/catalog/academic-regulations/) as well as policies listed below.

## FAQ

- **Q: I understand that a computer will be required to complete homework and other course work. Should I expect to bring my laptop to class everyday?**
	+ **A**: Most in-class activities will be paper-based but often will require looking up information in the textbook. I suggest having a device, preferably a laptop.
