## TL;DR

- I want you to succeed. Your classmates want you to succeed.
- Organic chemistry is a hard subject. This is especially true for an intense intersession course (1 day = 1 week of regular semester).
- This course is designed according to _flipped learning_ model. It doesn't mean it is asynchronous.
- This course uses an alternative grading system called _growth grading_. There are no points and no partial credit.  
- Your learning will be assessed with Learning Target problems, homework assignments (IPs), and a final exam (multiple choice ACS exam).
- It doesn't matter what textbook you use but official text (Klein 4 ed) has some perks and is easily obtained via Kennel Bookstore.
- Course ends with a final exam on Friday 6/10 at 9 am.

### Course materials and technology

:::info 
This course is part of the Immediate Access program. All students have access to a digital version of the textbook and associated materials on the first day of class. Students who wish to purchase course materials on their own can opt-out before their account is automatically charged on the 10th day (5th day for Summer courses) of instruction. Contact the Kennel Bookstore for more details.
:::

**Textbook:** "Organic Chemistry" online textbook with integrated Study Guide and Solutions Manual by David Klein 4th edition published by Wiley (via Immediate Access). It is okay to use prior editions of the textbook but you may not have the access to the WileyPLUS platform (see below).

**WileyPLUS:** Online learning platform and homework. WileyPLUS is integrated with Canvas and all links to assignments and materials will be posted on Canvas. [^WileyPLUS-version]

**A personal computer**: running Windows or macOS, that can run desktop applications and has a reliable access to high-speed internet. A tablet device is an acceptable alternative, but the online homework platform is not optimized for mobile devices.

**A modern web browser**: Chrome is the recommended browser by Fresno State IT. Other browsers such as Edge, Firefox, or Safari are likely to work just as well but the support will be limited.

**Canvas:** The central repository for all course materials and information found here:  
  [https://fresnostate.instructure.com](https://fresnostate.instructure.com).
<!-- **Document scanning tool**: Many assignments in this course are designed to be prepared by hand on paper. Few people own document scanners nowadays, but a mobile device with a scanning app can do a sufficient job at converting paper documents into PDFs. There are number of options available for both iOS and Android. Find one that you like and learn how to use it. -->

**Active Fresno State network account** so that you can access email, Canvas, and Google Suite. If you have any issue with accessing any of the above, please let me know as soon as possible. We will use a variety of additional course tools during the semester, but they will be free to use, and you will be taught how to use them as part of the class.

[^WileyPLUS-version]: WileyPLUS version must be the same as the official edition of the textbook (4th ed.). If you opt out of Immediate Access and buy the textbook and access to WileyPLUS through other means, make sure that your access code is for the 4th edition of the textbook.

## About the course

In Organic Chemistry 2 you will **continue to learn about structure, properties, and reactivity of organic compounds**. Carbon-based molecules are central to a host of chemical and biological processes because of their broad range of structure and reactivity. The billions of organic compounds alone, ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals, make the field important for study. Yet, organic chemistry is also a highly integrated discipline that impacts and is impacted by the other branches of chemistry and other sciences, because **organic chemistry enables a molecular understanding of physicochemical phenomena in materials science, the environment, biology, and medicine**. Because the field has reached a high level of integration with these areas, progress in organic chemistry continues at a fast pace and much more remains to be discovered.

Before reading any further, here are some things to know:

1. **The pace of this course is dangerously fast**. In one day is equivalent to one week of class during the regular semester. To reduce the risk of falling behind, check announcements and the calendar daily; get to work immediately on assignments; and above all stay active, ask questions and don't procrastinate. 
2. **College-level chemistry is more than just memorizing structures and reactions**. You will be asked to do more than just give answers to problems. Your goal should be to seek deep understanding of underlying concepts because they are universal and the list is much shorter than a disconnected list of reactions and reagents.
1. **Your success in the course depends on your willingness to be actively engaged during class time**. We will spend most of the in-class time practicing the skills related to learning targets. Students who approach the class with a passive mindset typically struggle, and often fail. Those who approach it with an active mindset, on the other hand, often surprise themselves with how much and how well they learn.
3. **Asking questions is a not a sign of weakness**. It is guaranteed that you will be confused, lost, and stuck every day we meet in class. **That's a good sign!** Asking and answering questions requires you to leave your comfort zones on a regular basis, but is a crucial ingredient in learning. 

**My #1 job as the professor is to make sure you succeed in learning.** Success in the course doesn't come cheap. Learning hard things involves hard work, a willingness to try things that might not work the first time, and the ability to improve using feedback. **But I promise you that I will work to make CHEM 128B a class where you can make mistakes and grow safely and productively.** 

## Course goals

The goal of this course is to drive the student to appreciate the breadth of organic chemistry by facilitating an understanding of the principles, and the practice of applying them, to gain a working knowledge and appreciation of organic structure and reactivity. The second semester in the sequence also emphesizes that our only way to molecular knowledge is through experimentation; correlating structure with reactivity and function through wet chemical methods, spectroscopy, and use of computational simulations.

## Assumed prior knowledge and skills

This course is a continuation of CHEM 128A. I am assuming that you come to this course already familiar with concepts and skills introduced in CHEM 128A and you are able to:

- communicate the structure and reactivity of organic molecules using drawing and naming conventions;
- analyze bonding and its consequences on molecular structure and reactivity of organic molecules; and
- analyze the interplay between electronic amd steric interactions as well as stereochemistry to predict the reactivity and properties of organic molecules and reactive intermediates (carbocations, radicals, anions, etc.).

## Course-level learning objectives

Concepts and skills listed above will be further developed and reinforced in CHEM 128B. Upon successful completion of CHEM 128B students will be able to:

- predict products, infer substrates, and propose reagents needed to complete a chemical reactions;
- use spectroscopic data to deduce the structure of the molecule.
- use retrosynthetic analysis to plan multi-step synthesis of target molecules; and
- use curved arrow notation to depict organic reaction mechanisms including addition, elimination, substitution, rearrangement, functional group interconversions and redox transformations.

## Course workflow

I designed this course according to the flipped learning model, an instructional philosophy optimized for active learning. Direct instruction is done before class meetings through structured activities (reading assignments, lecture videos) and class time is repurposed for collaborative work and practice. This [video series](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8484250) highlights the basics of flipped learning.

Our class meetings are very long (3 hours and 15 minutes). To maintain our energy at sufficient levels, I envisioned the following timeline of each class meeting:

| Time | Focus | 
| :--- | :---- |
| 09:00-09:30 | Q&A and review of the Daily Prep assignment followed by a 5-min break|
| 09:30-10:00 | Focused group work on problems followed a 5-min break |
| 10:00-10:30 | Focused group work on problems followed a 5-min break |
| 10:30-11:00 | Focused group work on problems followed a 5-min break |
| 11:00-11:30 | Summary of day's topics, wrap-up fo the day a 5-min break |
| 11:30-12:15 | LT Checkpoint & Office Hours |

**Before class**, your task will be to review previously covered material and get familiar with the basic concepts of the upcoming lesson by reading the appropriate sections in the textbook and completing **Daily Prep** assignment. This way, you'll come to class ready to work, and we can skip the lecturing in class unless it's really needed.

**Class time** is intended to focus on *answering questions* and *doing active work*. There may be some small lectures or tutorials, but active work will be the main component since the best way to learn organic chemistry is by doing lots of problems.

**After class** you must continue to engage with the material through deliberate practice and reflection on the ideas discussed in class. As you study, you should write down your questions and put into words what you don't yet understand. There will occasionally be **Integrated Problems** (IPs) to work on as well (see below). 

### Wednesday

_We will not meet on Wednesday_ to rest and regroup after Monday and Tuesday meetings. My hope is that you will use that time wisely, i.e., to study concepts, do practice problems, and reflect on feedback you receive from me. And of course, complete Daily Prep assignment for classes on Thursday and Friday. 

## Learning activities and assessments

To achieve the learning objectives of this course you will do a variety of things, but not all of them will be formally assessed or graded. 


- **Daily Prep** are WileyPLUS assignments that lead you through an active reading of the textbook and videos. 
- **Learning Targets** are main skills and tasks you should be able to do if you're achieving the learning objectives of the course. You will be asked to "demonstrate" your knowledge and skills mainly by taking short quizzes on them at regular intervals. 
<!-- 2. **Perusall** is a tool for collective and collaborative reading and annotating. We will use Perusall to read and discuss class material. Hopefully you're reading this syllabus on Perusall right now and getting the idea of how it works. -->
- **Mechanism Portfolio** is a collection of reaction mechanisms that you draw as you learn material in this course. Writing reaction mechanisms by using curved arrow notation will help you better understand reaction pathways.
- **Integrated Problems (IPs)** are more challenging problems that cannot be confined to a single learning objective or textbook chapter. The correctness of the solution and clarity of communication are equally important. 
- **Final exam** will be on **Friday, June 10th, 2022 at 9:00 am**. The final exam is composed of 70 multiple choice questions designed by experts from the American Chemical Society.

## The grading system in CHEM 128B {#grading}

:::info
Grading in this course is different than you might be used to. Please read this section carefully and ask questions as needed. 
:::

As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that **learning takes time** and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve **multiple attempts** that allow you to learn from your past mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I believe you should not be penalized for having a bad day that results in a bad test score, so long as you can show evidence that you've *eventually* learned what you need to learn. Course learning objectives are phrased as "at the end of the course the student should be able toâ€¦". Thus, nothing is final until the end of the course. 

I also strongly believe that *assigning points to your work is deeply unhelpful* for all parties involved. Points give the appearance of a scientific measurement, but in reality *all grading involves a judgment call by the instructor* based on their professional expertise. And points lead to arguments about points and grades (unhelpful) rather than learning and knowledge (helpful). I believe your work should be evaluated by just like everyone else's work in the real world is evaluated, i.e., by giving you: 

- *clearly defined standards* for quality, 
- *detailed verbal feedback* on your work instead of points, and 
- *opportunities to try again* based on the feedback. 
 
This gets you into a *feedback loop*, a conversation between you and me about your work, that continues until your work meets the standards (or we reach the end of the semester). In light of the principles outlined above, in this course:

* *there are no points on your work* except for Daily Preps and the final exam. (Daily Prep is recorded 0 or 1 but that's not a point, that's a "yes/no" label.); 
* *there is also no partial credit* awarded on your work, because there's no points; and
* students can *revise and resubmit almost any piece of work*, several times over if needed, using the feedback at each stage to improve and grow.

This is not as weird as it sounds. **It's actually the way all human learning works, and the way most professionals are evaluated in their work**. It only seems strange because it's not how school is typically done. But school and the real world are, well, not necessarily aligned. We will take the "real world" approach. Keep reading for more details.

### How each assignment is graded

Refer to the table for an overview of who each assignment is graded. Details are explained below. 

| Assignment       | How it's graded                                      | What's recorded in Canvas.                         |  
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |  
| Daily Prep       | Completeness and effort only                         | `1` for complete, good-faith effort; `0` otherwise |  
| Learning Targets | Completeness and correctness                         | *Successful* or *Retry* (see below)                |  
| IPs              | Completeness, effort, correctness, and communication | `E`, `M`, `R`, or `N` (see below)                  |  
| Final exam       | Completeness and correctness                         | Points, 70 maximum                                 |  

#### Learning Targets

Your primary responsibility in the course is to demonstrate your achievement of Learning Targets. The primary way you'll demonstrate skill is through *Learning Target Tests* given at the end of each class meeting. Each test will contain a pool problems, one per Learning Target. Each _Learning Target Test_ is cumulative, meaning the number of LT problems will grow as we cover more material. Problems for _new_ LTs will be added along with _new versions_ of LTs that are already in the pool. 

Successful demonstration of learning on a Learning Target will be marked *Successful*, work that doesn't yet meet the standards will be marked *Retry*. *Successful* does not mean _error-free_. A limited number of minor errors is allowed. See the companion document titled [Standards for Assessment](link) for detailed description of criteria for success.

Alternatively, you can demonstrate your skill on a Learning target via an oral quiz of sorts. I will give you a new version of a problem, and you work it out on the board "live". 

:::info
**Important**: Each _Learning Target_ requires two successful demonstrations of skill. Then, the Target is considered **completed** and no further assessment on that target is necessary.
:::

#### Integrated Problems (IPs)

Course grade of B or better asks you to show acceptable work on at least one Integrated Problem (IP). These problems involve a written solution as well as commentary that guides the reader throught the work. The process of assigning these marks is shown on the rubric diagram below:

![EMPX rubric](http://rtalbert.org/content/images/2022/04/EMRN-rubric-2020.png)

<!-- ## Revisions and reassessment {#revisions}

You can reattempt Learning Target problems which you did not master yet at a later *Checkpoint*. IPs earning M, P, or X can be revised and resubmitted at any time. They will be regraded using the same standards as originally used. Only three IP may be submitted for grading per week. This can be a mix of new submissions and revisions. One additional submission can be purchased with a [token](#tokens) (below). A token is required to revise IPs that were scored as "X" (Not Assessable).

## Tokens {#tokens}

Tokens are a fake currency that are used to "purchase" exceptions to course policies and other advantageous items in the course. Every student starts with five tokens which can be spent for any of the following at any time:

+ submit additional IP (either revision or new submission) in a given week;
+ revise an IP scored as "X"; and
+ extend the checkpoint deadline by 1 hour.

Tokens may not be "stacked". For example, by spending 3 tokens to get a 3-hour *Checkpoint* deadline extension. -->

### Final letter grade

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column for that grade, **the highest grade for which all the requirements are met**. There are no statistical or numerical adjustments (a.k.a. grading on a curve). Failing grade (F) is given if not all the requirements for a "D" are met. In the table below, numerical values indicate the minimum level needed to meet the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the requirement. For IP's, "M+" means "M" or better (either "M" or "E").

| Category               | D               | C  | B   | A       |  
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -- | --- | ------- |  
| Daily Prep (16)        | 5               | 8  | 11  | 14      |  
| LTs Completed (16)     | 5               | 8  | 11  | 14      |  
| All CORE Completed (7) | No              | No | Yes | Yes     |  
| IP                     |                 |    | 1M+ | 1E, 1M+ |  
| Mechanism Portfolio    | 14              | 20 | 26  | 32      |  
<!--                     | Perusall points | 6  | 9   | 12      | 15 | -->  
| Final Exam (ACS)       | 21              | 28 | 35  | 42      |  

:::success
**Example**: At the end of the semester Alex accomplished the following:

- completed 14 out of 16 Daily Prep assignments;
- completed (= done two successful demonstrations of skill on) 12 Learning Targets, including all CORE LTs; 
- submitted 3 IPs (one graded "E", two graded "M");
- collected 30 mechanisms in the Portfolio; and
- earned 54 points on the final exam.

Looking across the column for grade of "B", Alex satisfied all the requirements for that grade. Although Alex's work on Daily Preps, IPs, and the final exam is at grade "A" level, not all requirements for "A" are met, and Alex earns "B" in the course. 

**Important:** You can't make-up unsuccessful work on IPs, for example, by doing more Learning Targets. Also, you don't have to do it all. If you aim for "A", you don't have to complete _every Learning Target_, only 14 of them (as long as all CORE LTs are among them).

# Course policies

## Technology issues when submitting work

It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to make sure these items are submitted on time, even if technology issues arise. Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload a Lab to Canvas and Canvas wonâ€™t accept the file, you should try again later, use different browser, upload to Google Drive and share a private link or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.

## Academic integrity

Academic dishonesty carries with it strong punitive measures mandated by Fresno State policies, including possible automatic failure of the course or suspension from the university. Details are described in Academic Policy Manual 235 which you can read here: [http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf](http://www.fresnostate.edu/aps/documents/apm/235.pdf). __Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.__

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at others it may not be allowed. Here are the rules for collaboration on each kind of work you do:

+ *Mechanism Portfolio*: You may collaborate with others, but your writeup must be your own. You may not copy someone's work and submit it as your own, nor may you copy the ideas from someone and simply change how it's presented (or change wording).
+ *Checkpoints*, *IPs*, and *ACS exam*: No interactions at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed. Any evidence of using information from another person or source will be investigated as academic dishonesty.

### Resources you can and cannot use when submitting graded work

Here are the approved resources you can access on all _Checkpoints_:

* the textbook;
* video or document posted on Canvas site for this courses (but not other courses);
* Perusall discussions and annotations;
* slides, class meeting notes, and other materials generated during class time; and
* class zoom recordings.

**Any resource NOT included on this list is to be considered off-limits and not approved for use on Checkpoints. Evidence of using unapproved resources will be considered academic dishonesty.** This includes:

- solution websites such as Chegg;
- other students in the class, or past students from other CHEM 128 classes; and
- other textbooks or videos not included above.

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is my determination to make based on the evidence. If I determine academic dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of Students office, and the minimum penalty will be:

- "no pass" grade on a checkpoint and no possibility for retake;
- grade of "N" on IP assignment and no possibility for revision; and
- point deduction on final ACS exam.

## Deadlines and late work

Deadlines for course work are clearly indicated on the Course Calendar; in cases of apparent conflict between dates, always assume that the Course Calendar is right.

+ *Mechanism Portfolio and Perusall Activities*: No extensions to deadlines are available. Simply submit a good faith effort on all items by the deadline.
+ *Checkpoints*: Submission window may be extended by spending a token. No other extensions are available.
+ *IPs*: There is only one deadline for IP's: **Monday, July 19th, 2021 at 5 pm** Otherwise you simply submit your work when it is ready to be graded (subject to weekly limits). This deadline will not be extended.

## Intellectual Property

As part of your participation in virtual/online instruction, please remember that the same student conduct rules that are used for in-person classrooms instruction also apply for virtual/online classrooms. Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication of any academic presentation, including any online classroom instruction, for any commercial purpose. In addition, students may not record or use virtual/online instruction in any manner that would violate copyright law. Students are to use all online/virtual instruction exclusively for the educational purpose of the online class in which the instruction is being provided. Students may not re-record any online recordings or post any online recordings on any other format (e.g., electronic, video, social media, audio recording, web page, internet, hard paper copy, etc.) for any purpose without the explicit written permission of the faculty member providing the instruction. Exceptions for disability-related accommodations will be addressed by Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) working in conjunction with the student and faculty member.

## Dropping the course

Dates and details on withdrawing from courses are described on the [Admissions web pages](http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html).

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition. Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.

## Changes to this syllabus

Changes to this syllabus may occur during the term. In those cases, the changes will be announced in class and online, and if appropriate, students will be given a voice on how the changes will be implemented. It is your responsibility stay abreast of the information passed along in course announcements so that you will be aware of any changes that take place.

## Credits

Large portions of the language of this syllabus as well as ideas related to mastery grading and flipped learning were adapted from the syllabi of [Prof. Robert Talbert](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235) (Grand Valley University).
