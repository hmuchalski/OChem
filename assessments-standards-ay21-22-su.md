# Standards for Assessment in CHEM 128B

This document contains all the details for what constitutes "successful" or "acceptable" work on each type of assignment in the course. Use the table of contents in the upper-left to navigate to specific assignment types. 

## Daily Prep

Daily Prep assignments are adaptive WileyPLUS assignments. You get credit for completing the assignment before the deadline and giving each item a good faith effort to solve it correctly. As you answer questions you will see the Progress Bar move, it can increase and decrease based on how you’re doing. Once you reach the threshold of 50% AND attempt all questions you earn credit for this assignment.  

:::info
WileyPLUS assignments use adaptive learning engine. This means that then number and difficulty of questions is determined by how you are doing. Before each batch of questions you will be asked to review appropriate sections of the textbook. Incorrect answers are not penelized, i.e., the difficulty is adjusted until you answer correctly, although some additional review may be needed.

## Learning Targets

There are two different ways to demonstrate skill on a Learning Target: 

- by working a problem on a Learning Target tests, or
- by working a problem in an oral quiz during office hours.

Both **written and oral quizzes** are graded on the basis of *completeness and correctness*. A mark of `Successful` will show on the page and "1" will show on Canvas if the work meets the standards; a mark of `Retry` is recorded otherwise. 

| The work receives a mark of... | If it meets these criteria: | 
| :----: | ---- | 
| **Successful** | <ul><li>Each part of the problem has a good-faith attempt at a response, *and*</li><li>The response contains **no more than two simple errors**, and **no non-simple errors**, *and*</li><li>Unless specifically stated otherwise, the response must show all the significant steps used to arrive at the answers.</li></ul>
| **Retry** | Not all the standards for "Successful" are met. |

**Note:** The above are *general* criteria for successful demonstrations of skill on a quiz problem. Some quiz problems may have different or more targeted criteria that will be clearly stated on the quiz.

### Alternative ways to demonstrate skill

:::success
You can demonstrate your skill and knowledge by taking an **oral quiz**. In this option, you schedule time with me to meet before or after class, during which I’ll give you a new instance of a problem, and you work it out “live”.

### What is a "simple error"?

For CHEM 128B, a "simple" error is defined to be *an error in logic, computation, or communication that does not pertain to the learning target and does not oversimplify the problem*.

An example of a *simple error* would be missing a formal charge on a functional group that is not the active participant in a reaction or "miscopy" of the structure from one part of the solution to another (different number of carbons). However, if the reaction in context is a carbon–carbon bond forming reaction and the number of carbons is inconsistent, then it is a non-simple error.  

Note that **an error that is considered "simple" in one situation may be "non-simple" in another**. For example,  structure drawing error in LT 9–11 would be _non-simple error_ because the entire target is about determining structure of an unknown compound given the spectroscopic data. The same error may be considered _simple error_ in multi-step synthesis problems where structures are redrawn multiple times and different atoms are the focus of chemical transformation. 

But keep in mind that **only two simple errors are allowed on any Learning Target** problem. So always **double-check your work** when possible, and proofread your solutions before submitting them.  

## IPs

IP solutions are graded on the basis of *completeness, correctness, and communication quality*. Solutions are marked using the **EMRN rubric** shown below.

### Specific requirements for "Meets Expectations"

:::success
Note: **The audience for all IP solutions is your classmates** --- people who have the background mathematical knowledge that you have, but who have no familiarity with the problem you are working on. **The instructor (prof. Muchalski) not the audience, and neither are you**---so don't assume that the person reading the solution has a Ph.D. in organic chemistry or has been studying the problem for a while. 
::: 

For an IP solution to "Meet Expectations", it must: 

- Obey fundamental rules of English usage such as correct spelling, proper use of punctuation, use of complete sentences and proper paragraph structure, and so on. 
- Be chemically correct and include no significant errors. Note that *minor* errors can sometimes be acceptable as long as they don't derail the solution. You should always proofread your work to debug those errors, because sometimes an error that is minor in one context is significant in another. 
- Give not just an answer but a full, convincing, and well-reasoned commentary. 
- Present a solution that thoughtfully combines chemistry and verbal explanations to be clear and convincing to the intended audience. When giving a solution, don't just present a "wall of structures/reactions/symbols" without verbal description. Likewise, don't write a block of text describing the solution without using the graphical language of organic chemistry. Instead, use a combination of words, structures, reactions, and mechanisms that explains your ideas clearly to a standard audience. 

### Specific requirements for "Excellent/Exemplary"

An exemplary solution must first meet all objectives listed for "Meets Expectations". In addition, your work must also be very well communicated. In simple terms, "Excellent/Exemplary" work could be used as class handout. A student in our class who is familiar with organic chemistry terminology and conventions, could just from reading your solution. Here are some guidelines:

* **Demonstrate fluency and comfort with the ideas in your solution**. Show that you fully understand what matters (and what doesn’t) in your solution, and how to properly use all terminology and ideas.
* **Write concisely and elegantly**. Find the most direct, clear, and unambiguous way to say what you mean. Avoid irrelevant flourishes or details. If you find a complex solution that requires many cases or a page of gnarly computations, perhaps there is a simpler way to do it -- find that simpler approach.

### Criteria for "Not Assessable"

An IP submission is marked `N` (Not Assessable) if it does not represent a good-faith effort to meet the standards. This mark will be given in *any* of these circumstances: 

- Part of the solution is blank, partially complete, or contains insignificant attempts at a solution. For example, completing part of a problem and then explaining that you didn't know how to complete the other parts will result in an`N`.  
- There are significant and numerous major errors or misconceptions on chemistry or logic that occur throughout the work.
- The submission is significantly disorganized, illegible, messy, or unprofessionally written up. Text that is handwritten must be legible. IP solutions that are marked `N` will be marked and returned without feedback (except for an explanation why it was marked `N`).
