## Week 2

### Day 5 (Tuesday, 2022-05-31)


## Week 1

### Day 4 (Friday, 2022-05-27)

**Summary**: We began class with a super long, but much needed review of reactions from 1st semester OChem. While doing that, we clarified concepts related to acidâ€“base theory. The rest of the class was spent discussing NMR spectroscopy. We solved two problems (LT style) and leanred how to extract useful information from NMR spectrum (chemical shift, integration, and multiplicity) and turn it into structural information. We finished, again, with an hour-long LT session.

### Day 3 (Thursday, 2022-05-26)

**Summary**: We started class with a follow-up discussion about two types of mechanisms for opening of epoxide rings: 

- acid-catalyzed mechanism where weak nucleophiles (water, alcohols, amines) attack the electrophilic carbon that is most stabilized at transition state; and
- opening of epoxides by strong nucleophiles where least sterically congested carbon is attaced. 

The rest of the class was focused on spectroscopic methods. Specifically, we learned how to propose a plausible structure of a compound from its IR and MS spectra.

### Day 2 (Tuesday, 2022-05-24)

**Summary**: During the second class meeting we learned how to navigate the jungle of reactions by first learning to classify tranformations in more general terms (addition, elimination, substitution, reduction, additions, etc.) and then finding specific reagents to accomplish the transformation. We also spent some time discussing the mechanism of addition of hydrides and organomagnesium reagents to carbonyls. We concluded the day by taking the very first set of LTs. We don't meet on Wednesday.

### Day 1 (Monday, 2022-05-23)

**Summary**: We met the first time and discussed the syllabus and the grading system used in the class. We took advantage of 12 (!) white boards around the classroom to review key concepts and topics from CHEM 128A. We started with a discussion of electron delocalization and how resonance structures are used to communicate overall electronic character of a molecule. We discussed how to compare the strength of acids and bases using pKa and ARIOS method. We talked how thermodynamics and kinetics of a chemical reaction can be communicated with energy diagrams and how mechanisms will can be use to show divergent outcomes of chemical reactions.
